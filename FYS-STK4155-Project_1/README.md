# FYS-STK4155-Prosjekt-1
First project in FYS-STK4155 with deadline 11.10.2022.

## Prerequisites for running

Python 3 is used for running the code. Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn and Imageio is needed. These can be installed with this command: `pip3 install numpy matplotlib sklearn imageio`

## Running
Each file at the format `Part[B-F].py` are entrypoints that can be executed. One for each subtask in the project. The files can be executed with two different datasets, `real` or `test`. A console argument of either `real` or `test` is needed to determine the dataset to use. Example on running part b with real data: `python3 src/PartB.py real`, or with test data: `python3 src/PartB.py test`.
